## Our Mission

Masajid USA is a comprehensive directory of Islamic places of worship across the United States. Our goal is to make it easy for Muslims to find masajid in their area, whether they're traveling, relocating, or simply looking for a new community.

## Data Source

All masjid data is sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), an open-source mapping project. This means our data is community-maintained and freely available.

## Contributing

If you notice a masjid is missing or has incorrect information, you can help by:

1. Adding or updating the information on OpenStreetMap
2. The changes will eventually be reflected in our directory

## Contact

This is an open-source project. For questions or suggestions, please reach out through our repository.
